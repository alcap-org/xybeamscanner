# xybeamscanner
To upload code to the beam scanner, you need to install the Arduino IDE found in https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

You also need the makeblock library, found in https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Library

Make sure the selected board in the Arduino IDE is Arduino/Genuino UNO and the serial port is correct. If you are using a Mac, you need to download an extra driver, CH341SER from http://0xcf.com/2015/03/13/chinese-arduinos-with-ch340-ch341-serial-usb-chip-on-os-x-yosemite/
